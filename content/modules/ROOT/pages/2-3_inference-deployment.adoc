= Deploying AI Model Inference Server

In this section, we will deploy the AI model inference server that will serve our battery monitoring models. The inference server is a critical component that enables real-time AI predictions for battery stress detection and time-to-failure estimation.

The inference server is responsible for loading and serving our AI models to make predictions based on real-time sensor data. Red Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed provides a single-model serving platform based on the KServe component of Kubernetes. The inference server is necessary for:

* *Real-time predictions*: It provides low-latency inference capabilities for our battery monitoring system, enabling immediate responses to sensor data
* *Model serving*: It loads and manages our AI models (_stress-detection_ and _time-to-failure_) from the MinIO storage
* *API endpoints*: It exposes RESTful APIs that our Battery Monitoring System can query for predictions
* *Resource efficiency*: It optimizes model loading and inference performance in the constrained edge environment

The inference server uses KServe custom resource definitions (CRDs) to define the lifecycle of deployment objects, storage access, and networking setup, making it ideal for our autonomous vehicle's edge deployment.

== Deploying Inference Server using GitOps

We will deploy the inference server using the same GitOps approach we used with MinIO, ensuring consistent deployment and management of our edge components.

=== Step 1: Deploy GitOps Application

Deploy the inference server GitOps application:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: model-server
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  destination:
    name: ''
    namespace: ''
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  source:
    path: bootstrap/model-server/groups/dev
    repoURL: https://github.com/rhpds/ai-lifecycle-edge-gitops.git
    targetRevision: main
  sources: []
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
EOF
----

The GitOps Application will deploy the following Inference components:

* *Namespace*: An _inference_ namespace that isolates all AI model serving resources from other system components.
* *ServingRuntime*: OpenVINO Model Server configuration supporting multiple model formats including OpenVINO IR, ONNX, TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, and PyTorch. This runtime provides optimized edge inference with both REST and gRPC protocol support.
* *Service and Route*: Network components that expose inference endpoints for external access, enabling the Battery Monitoring System to query AI models through REST APIs.
* *Service Account*: Kubernetes service account configured with S3 access permissions to retrieve models from MinIO storage.
* *InferenceServices*: Two specialized inference services that load and serve AI models from MinIO storage:
  - Stress-detection service for identifying battery stress conditions
  - Time-to-failure service for predicting remaining battery life

These components work together to provide a complete AI model serving solution that can load models from MinIO storage and serve real-time predictions for our battery monitoring system.

Monitor the deployment progress to ensure all components are properly deployed:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
watch oc get pods -n inference
----

[NOTE]
====
_You can exit the watch command by pressing *Ctrl+C* in your keyboard._
====

When all pods show `Running` status, the inference server deployment is complete and ready to serve AI models.

=== Step 2: Check Inference Endpoints

Once deployed, you can check the inference endpoints by running: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc get inferenceservice -n inference
----

The inference server will be ready to serve predictions for both battery stress-detection and time-to-failure models.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
