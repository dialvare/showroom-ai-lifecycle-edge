= Start a new data science project

Data Science Projects in RHOAI are used to organize users and AI-application related resources around a single shared space.

. Make sure you are in the *Red Hat OpenShift AI Dashboard*. Remember that it can be accessed trough the OpenShift Web Console or directly on this URL:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
----

[start=2]

. Start by locating the *Data Science Projects* tab on the menu on the left.
. Click the *Create project* button. A new window will pop-up.
. There you can type your preferred project name. In my case, the *Name* will be `ai-edge-project`. Optionally, you can add a description.
. Then, click *Create*. You will be redirected to the project dashboard page. With this, a new namespace called `ai-edge-project` will be created in your OpenShift node.
