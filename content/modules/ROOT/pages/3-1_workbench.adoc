= Create a workbench

Inside the new project, we can create different components. One of them, and probably the most important one when it comes to model training, will be the Workbench. A workbench is a containerized workspace that operates within a pod and contains a collection of different AI/ML libraries and a JupyterLab server.

. There are different tabs inside our project page. Click on *Workbenches*.
. On there, select the *Create workbench* button to open the configuration window.
. Complete the fields as follows. You will see that there are plenty of different configurations depending on your model and environment specifications:
 ** *Name*: Type your preferred name. I will use `model-training`.
 ** *Image selection*: the election will depend on the model requirements. Click on View package information to see the packages included. Our model will use `Pytorch`.
 ** *Version selection*: The recommendation is to use the latest package versions. That will be the `2024.2` version.
 ** *Container size*: we can select the resources assigned depending on our hardware: number of CPUs, memory, and request capacity of the container. In this case, the `Small` size is enough.
 ** Check the *Create new persistent storage* box.
  ** *Name*: Type any desired name for the persistent volume. For example, `model-training`.
  ** *Persistent storage size*: Specify the desired capacity for the volume. I will start with `20GB`, but we can always expand it if necessary.
. Right now, I will not attach any Data Connection to this workbench. We will see how to set up and use object storage in the next section of this article.
. Review your configuration and press *Create workbench*. This last step will trigger the workbench creation.
. You will be automatically redirected to another page where you can track the workbench deployment process. Wait until the _Status_ shows *Running* and click *Open*.

. A new tab will open. Enter again your OpenShift credentials to authenticate to the workbench's JupyterLab platform.
