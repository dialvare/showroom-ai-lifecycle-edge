= Create a workbench

Inside the new project, we can create different components. One of them, and probably the most important one when it comes to model training, will be the Workbench. A workbench is a containerized workspace that operates within a pod and contains a collection of different AI/ML libraries and a JupyterLab server.

. There are different tabs inside our project page. Click on *Workbenches*.
. On there, select the *Create workbench* button to open the configuration window.
. Complete the fields as follows. You will see that there are plenty of different configurations depending on your model and environment specifications:
 ** *Name*: Type your preferred name. I will use `model-training`.
 ** *Image selection*: the election will depend on the model requirements. Click on View package information to see the packages included. Our model will use `Pytorch`.
 ** *Version selection*: The recommendation is to use the latest package versions. That will be the `2024.2` version.
 ** *Container size*: we can select the resources assigned depending on our hardware: number of CPUs, memory, and request capacity of the container. In this case, the `Small` size is enough.
 ** Check the *Create new persistent storage* box.
  ** *Name*: Type any desired name for the persistent volume. For example, `model-training-pv`.
  ** *Persistent storage size*: Specify the desired capacity for the volume. I will start with `20GB`, but we can always expand it if necessary.
. Right now, I will not attach any Data Connection to this workbench. We will see how to set up and use object storage in the next section of this article.
. Review your configuration and press *Create workbench*. This last step will trigger the workbench creation.
. You will be automatically redirected to another page where you can track the workbench deployment process. Wait until the _Status_ shows *Running* and click *Open*.
. A new tab will open. Enter again your OpenShift credentials to authenticate to the workbench's JupyterLab platform.

The JupyterLab platform can be used to create custom Notebooks to build and train AI models. But that's something we will see on the next chapter. Let's continue!
