= Solving a real-world challenge: Our case study

Batteries play a crucial role in the current context of transitioning to electric mobility. These components act as the heart of electric vehicles (EVs), and therefore, one of the most critical pieces of the car. An unexpected failure in one of the cells that composes the battery can lead to significant performance degradation and safety risks. And here is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes into play. 

== Developing an AI Solution for the Electric Vehicle

For this lab we will take the role of a systems engineer working for an automotive company that wants to enhance battery management and operations in electric vehicles. The team's mission is to create an end-to-end solution at the edge that addresses two different scenarios:

=== Battery Monitoring System
In our SNO, we need to run an application responsible for monitoring the health of the electric car battery. To achieve this, we will need to train and use two AI models to detect battery stress and predict the time this component could potentially fail. This prediction will be made based on simulated data from various parameters such as voltage, temperature, driving distance or velocity. All this data should be accessible from a graphical dashboard.

=== Charging Optimization
On an RHEL machine running MicroShift, we will need to deploy an application that interacts with the battery monitoring system to optimize charging patterns at an EV charging station. This application will use another AI model to enhance charging efficiency and extend battery lifespan.
