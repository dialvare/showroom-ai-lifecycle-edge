= Automating with pipelines

Automating workflows at the edge could be considered one of the most crucial activities for organizations seeking to reduce latency, maintain robust security standards and enhance the overall efficiency. The edge can be a remote unpleasant place where tasks need to continue running autonomously even in the worst scenarios, since there are usually no working crews on site that can take actions on such critical systems. The solution therefore lies in task automation.

It's possible to create pipelines by dragging and connecting Notebooks using the Elyra extension. The second alternative, -and the one we will use- is by importing an existing pipeline in YAML format created using the KubeFlow Pipelines SDK. This programmatic platform uses Python to simplify the process of writing and building the pipeline.
