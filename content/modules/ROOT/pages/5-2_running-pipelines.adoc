= Automating with pipelines

Then, all the pipelines can be stored and executed in that server instance. Red Hat OpenShift AI gives the possibilities to import an already existing YAML file containing the pipeline's code or to create a new one within JupyterLab, using the Elyra extension.

It's possible to create pipelines by dragging and connecting Notebooks using the Elyra extension. The second alternative, -and the one we will use- is by importing an existing pipeline in YAML format created using the KubeFlow Pipelines SDK. This programmatic platform uses Python to simplify the process of writing and building the pipeline.
